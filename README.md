This is the project that automatically creates a Student Attendance Tracker system. When the script runs, it asks for a tracker name and creates a folder called attendance_tracker_<input> with the correct structure, including Helpers, reports, attendance_checker.py, config.json, assets.csv, and reports.log. The script checks if python3 is installed and shows the version if it is available. I used mkdir -p so the script does not crash if folders already exist, and I added a check to make sure the main folder is created correctly. The script also allows the user to change the attendance warning and failure thresholds, and it checks that the values entered are numbers before updating the config file. I also used a signal trap with trap cleanup SIGINT, so if the user presses Ctrl+C, the script creates a zip archive of the project and deletes the incomplete folder to prevent clutter. Overall, this project shows automation, input checking, environment validation, and proper cleanup, and it runs from start to finish without manual setup
